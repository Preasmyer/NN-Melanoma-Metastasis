Project repository for melanoma metastasis prediction research using neural network architectures

### Model Performance Showcase

This repository contained a jupyterlab notebook showcasing project performance as mandated by the grading criteria. The main Notebook for this is ResNetHE.ipynb

### Cleaning and Processing Scripts

The other documents located in this repository point toward the scripts that I created and used to process the data and define the date pipeline. Much of the data used in this project is confidential and cannot be showcased publicly, but the scripts used to wrangle and move the data can be shown. feel free to peruse these scripts to get an idea of the state of the data before and after their use.
